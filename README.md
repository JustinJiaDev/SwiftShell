# SwiftShell

Bash is important. But bash is also old.

We want a shell that has better syntax highlighting, auto completion, error handling... 

We want to execute commands just like how we write our code.

Can we use our IDEs as the terminal?

## Build Process

1. Clone the repo or download the zip file.
2. Open `SwiftShell.xcworkspace`.
3. `Command + B` to build the framework ([Reason](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/Playground_Help/Chapters/ImportFramework.html)).
4. Select `SwiftShell.playground`.
