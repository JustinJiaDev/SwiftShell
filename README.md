# SwiftShell

Bash is important. But bash is also old.

We want something that has better syntax highlighting, auto completion, error handling...

We want to execute commands just like how we write our code.

Can we use Xcode as our terminal?

## Getting Started

1. Install Xcode 8.
2. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
3. Open `SwiftShell.xcodeproj`.
4. `Command + B` to build the framework ([Reason](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/Playground_Help/Chapters/ImportFramework.html)).
5. Select `SwiftShell.playground`.
